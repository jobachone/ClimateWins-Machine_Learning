# ClimateWins Machine Learning Achievement 2: Semisupervised and Unsupervised Models.

ClimateWins tasked me  to assess what tools are available to categorize and predict the weather in mainland Europe. It’s concerned with theincrease in extreme weather events, especially in the past 10 to 20 years.

However, it thinks that even weather extremes could be predicted and planned for using advanced tools such as machine learning. With data from the past century, it hopes to create a model for what the future will hold.

Objectives: 
● Finding new patterns in weather changes over the last 60 years.

● Identifying weather patterns outside the regional norm in Europe.

● Determining whether unusual weather patterns are increasing.

● Generating possibilities for future weather conditions over the next 25 to 50 years based
on current trends.

● Determining the safest places for people to live in Europe within the next 25 to 50 years

## Models Implemented:
#### Random Forest models
#### Convolution Neural Network (CNN)
#### Recursive Neural Network (RNN)
#### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
#### Hyperparameter Optimization

## Dataset:
Courtesy of the European Climate Assessment and Dataset project (https://www.ecad.eu/), including weather observations from 18 different weather stations across Europe containing data from the late 1800s to 2022, with values such as temperature, wind speed, global radiation, precipitation, and more.

# ClimateWins Machine Learning Achievement 1: Supervised Machine Learning

Conducted for my Specialization in Data Analytics course with CareerFoundry;

ClimateWins, a hypothetical European cliamte advocacy non-profit, is looking to implement a model to garner insights on the effects of climate change, and ultimately use Machine Learning to predict climate change's consequences. 

Using weather data from 18 different weather stations across Europe, spanning back to the 1960s to today, I implemented different Supervised Learning ML models with a training dataset "pleasant_wx", that rates each day based on whether the weather was pleasant or not, 0 or 1.

The models implemented:
## Artificial Neural Network
## Decision Tree
## K-Nearest Neighbors

Their success was determined by their percentage accuracy for the training data and the test data, which was randomized and split.
I also visualized their accuracy with confusion matrices.

The repository is organized as follows:

### 01 - Project Management
- Achievement Brief
