# ClimateWins Machine Learning

Conducted for my Specialization in Data Analytics course with CareerFoundry;

ClimateWins, a hypothetical European cliamte advocacy non-profit, is looking to implement a model to garner insights on the effects of climate change, and ultimately use Machine Learning to predict climate change's consequences. 

Using weather data from 18 different weather stations across Europe, spanning back to the 1960s to today, I implemented different Supervised Learning ML models with a training dataset "pleasant_wx", that rates each day based on whether the weather was pleasant or not, 0 or 1.

The models implemented:
## Artificial Neural Network
## Decision Tree
## K-Nearest Neighbors

Their success was determined by their percentage accuracy for the training data and the test data, which was randomized and split.
I also visualized their accuracy with confusion matrices.

The repository is organized as follows:

### 01 - Project Management
- Achievement Brief
### 02 - Data
- unscaled weather data
- scaled weather data
- pleasant weather prediction data
### 03 - Scripts
- Conducted in Juypter Notebook
### 04 - Analysis
- Visualizations
### 05 - Deliverables
- Powerpoint Presentation to ClimateWins stakeholders.
